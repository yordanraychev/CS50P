# CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python

I recently completed the 10-week-long CS50â€™s Introduction to Programming with Python certificate. The course covered a wide range of programming topics, including functions, variables, conditionals, loops, exceptions, libraries, unit tests, file I/O, regular expressions, and object-oriented programming. Each week introduced new concepts and challenged me to apply them through problem sets and a final project. Overall, it was an incredibly rewarding experience.
